                You don’t agree and drag her back.
                This makes her <strong>quite upset</strong>, <em>but you surely know 
                what’s best for her don't you?</em><br>
                She makes her appearance in front of the noble guests 
                and all appears to go smoothly.
                <strong>Suddenly a man dressed in a server’s uniform 
                rushes past you holding a tray of champagne,
                <em>walking straight to the princess.</em></strong>
                You swear you’ve never seen this person among the staff before!<br>
                You quickly stop him and ask what he’s doing.
                He says he’s new and was ordered to serve the drinks to the princess.
                He’s a young kid... <sub>could just be new to the job.</sub>
