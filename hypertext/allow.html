            You let him go and he approaches the princess.<br>
            <sup>Her eyes narrow at the unfamiliar face.</sup>
            She <em>refuses</em> to drink until <strong>he takes a sip.</strong><br>
            The young man’s face <em>pales</em> as he brings a cup to his lips.<br>
            His hands <sup>shake</sup> and <sub>spill</sub> some of the drink on his clothes.<br>
            The princess ordered the guards to drag this pathetic display away.<br>
            <strong>She then points towards <em><strong>you</strong></em> and orders the same.</strong><br>
            It seems she holds <em>a grudge against you</em> after ruining her plans of escape.<br><br>
            <h4>A loyal companion you were to her, and now you rot in the castle’s dungeon for the <em>rest of your days.</em></em>
