            You run around looking for her. 
            You search...

              <summary>             The bedroom</summary>
              <p>                   under the bed and behind the curtains!</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>                       The kitchen</summary>
              <p><strong><em>                                EEK! </em></strong>there's a mouse in the cabinet</p>

            </details>
            <em>Finally, you find her by the garden walls trying to <strong>escape the castle!</strong> </em>
            When you try to stop her she pleads with you to let her go for the night. 
            She suggests that you can take her place for the ball. 
            It will only be for a night, plus you’ll have a mask, what’s the harm?
